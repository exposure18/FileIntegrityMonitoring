This is what I have done for my Final Year Project in Cyber Security

Need to have Windows Powershell ISE
Just download and paste the code or open the file via Windows Powershell ISE

<br></br>

3) Select Start Monitoring, to check whether any changes are made, if a file has been deleted, created, or modified

4) Email will be sent for every changes has been detected, using via SMTP, which is gmail. So you need a gmail with the password which is the app password "Generating App Password" and paste it in the code. 
<br></br>
5) Logs can also be downloaded for auditing purposes.
